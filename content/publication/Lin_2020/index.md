abstract: Continuous neuronal survival is vital for mammals because mammalian brains have limited regeneration capability. After neurogenesis, suppression of apoptosis is needed to ensure a neuronâ€™s long-term survival. Here we describe a robust genetic program that intrinsically attenuates apoptosis competence in neurons. Developmental downregulation of the splicing regulator PTBP1 in immature neurons allows neural-specific splicing of the evolutionarily conserved Bak1 microexon 5. Exon 5 inclusion triggers nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) and unproductive translation of Bak1 transcripts (N-Bak mRNA), leading to suppression of pro-apoptotic BAK1 proteins and allowing neurons to reduce apoptosis. Germline heterozygous ablation of exon 5 increases BAK1 proteins exclusively in the brain, inflates neuronal apoptosis, and leads to early postnatal mortality. Therefore, neural-specific exon 5 splicing and depletion of BAK1 proteins uniquely repress neuronal apoptosis. Although apoptosis is important for development, attenuation of apoptosis competence through neural-specific splicing of the Bak1 microexon is essential for neuronal and animal survival.
