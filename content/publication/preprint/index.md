abstract: Nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) was originally conceived as an mRNA surveillance mechanism that recognizes and degrades nonsense transcripts to prevent the production of potentially deleterious truncated proteins. Recent research showed NMD is an important post-transcriptional gene regulation mechanism targeting many non-aberrant mRNAs. It adjusts the transcriptome and proteome outputs dynamically under varied physiological environments. However, how natural genetic variants affect NMD and modulate gene expressions remains elusive.
