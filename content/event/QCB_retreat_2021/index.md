summary: Our next yearly QCB retreat
abstract: "With 2021 ending, the QCB Department concludes its first year as a department. We now have six new tenure-track faculty members. Everyone who has already joined is very well funded. I want to warmly welcome Dr. Jazlyn Mooney who will join us from Stanford in January 2022.

We had a successful departmental retreat with everyone being back together. Our PhD students, Masterâ€™s students, and Postdocs presented fantastic research talks and posters. And we used the in-person retreat to strengthen our community."
